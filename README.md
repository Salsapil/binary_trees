**Binary Tree:**   
- A fundamental hierarchical data structure where each node can have at most two children: a left child and a right child. These nodes store data and pointers to their children.

### What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?   
**Binary Search Tree:** A specific type of binary tree where each node's value has a specific ordering property:   
- The value of a node is greater than all values in its left subtree.   
- The value of a node is less than all values in its right subtree.   
- This ordering allows for efficient searching and sorting operations.
